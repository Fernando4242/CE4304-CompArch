The purpose of this file is to provide a description of the worked done in the project.
The worked done can be divided into 4 main parts (files):

1. ALU.v
2. ALUControl.v
3. Control.v
4. TopeLevel.v

Each file had missing parts that needed to be filled in order to complete the circuit.
Results of the worked done can be found in the results.png file.

ALU.v
-----
Filled in the blank to complete the ALU. Specifically, the following operations were implemented:

    //implement other operation here.
    6'b001: out <= inA - inB; // subtract

To implement such operation, I took into account ALU Control Unit Truth table.

ALUControl.v
------------
Filled in the blank to complete the ALU Control Unit. Specifically, the following operations were implemented:

    //implement other operations here.
	6'b100010: aluFunc <= 3'b001; // subtraction

To implement such operation, I took into account ALU Control Unit Truth table. 
By doing so, I was able to assign the correct aluFunc for the given operation.

Control.v
---------
Filled in the blank to complete the Control. Specifically the following operations were implemented

	// implement control signals for sw, addi and beq here
	6'b101011: begin regDst <= 1'bx; jump <= 1'b0; aluSrc = 1'b1; memToReg = 1'bx; regWrite = 1'b0; memRead = 1'b0; memWrite = 1'b1; branch = 1'b0; aluOp = 2'b00; end // sw
	6'b001000: begin regDst <= 1'b0; jump <= 1'b0; aluSrc = 1'b1; memToReg = 1'b0; regWrite = 1'b1; memRead = 1'b0; memWrite = 1'b0; branch = 1'b0; aluOp = 2'b11; end // addi
	6'b000100: begin regDst <= 1'bx; jump <= 1'b0; aluSrc = 1'b0; memToReg = 1'bx; regWrite = 1'b0; memRead = 1'b0; memWrite = 1'b0; branch = 1'b1; aluOp = 2'b01; end // beq

To implement such operation, I took into account Main Control Unit Truth table. 
Which helped assign the correct value for each output.

TopLevel.v
----------
Filled in the blank to complete the TopLevel. Specifically, adding missing inputs/outputs and creating necessary ones to complete the circuit such as the following wire:
    
    wire [1:0] aluOp;

Which was used to connect the ALU Control Unit to the ALU.
